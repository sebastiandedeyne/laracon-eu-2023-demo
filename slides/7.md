# Strongly Typed Views in Laravel

1. View models
   - Make dependencies of a view explicit
   - Keep views & controllers lean
   - Easy to refactor & test
   - Use generics to make them reusable
2. Typed objects + TypeScript Transformer
    - Know what your server is returning (resource objects)
    - Know what your server expects (request objects)
    - Detect mismatches on CI
